Giant Wizards from the Outer Rim!

When you're a giant wizard,
All worlds seems tiny...

This is my entry into Ludum Dare 23, my first time! 

How to play
-----------
  - Extract the archive and run the "wizards" file
  - At the menu screen choose the configuration and press play
  - At the game screen, wait until it's your turn. Find your Wizard and choose an action Your mana increases every turn, so you might have to wait for some things
  - Note that the world wraps around (because it's Tiny, duh!) and your wizards can walk through the ocean, on account of them being giants
  - Click a square to perform that action on it. The movement cost into water is actually 2, so you can't move in when you only have 1 action point
  - Press end turn when you're done
  - The last survivor wins!

Known Bugs
