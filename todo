done - refactoring action choices
done - next and prev buttons for selecting
done - split movement / mana
done - Update AI to still be basic but move / shoot / summon
done - kill all wizards monsters on death
done - centre on the current moving guy?
done - make blasts line of sight blocked by trees / mountains
done - differentiate goblins? Maybe just show name on hover
done - make flash better(so not invisible)
     - add meditate (Turn movement into mana). Might do this so it's the only way to increase mana
done - try pixelmix font
done - info box about spells/what it does, what the current casting chance is, strength + name of the summoned creature if
       it's a creature summoning
done   - Start this by refactoring the UI code to be more sensible
       - Make the text boxes scrollable with a drag or scroll wheel    
       - Add a slider
done     - Make the action creators have a name of their own, like "wizard blast" for the different types of blasts, and show
           that in the button rather than the more explicit name like "epic wizard blast"
       - tabs in the description box to separate description, stats, abilities (for summons anyway)
     - nav bar along the bottom for selecting creatures
     - multi-turn commands?
     - issue commands to more than one unit? Draw box + shift selecting? Depends on balance, if we go for a fewer-stronger-monster
       kind of deal it may not be necessary
     - MOAR spells /creatures
     - AI
     - Name wizards, change number
     - help screen
