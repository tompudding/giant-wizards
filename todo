     - info box about spells/what it does, what the current casting chance is, strength + name of the summoned creature if
       it's a creature summoning
     - nav bar along the bottom for selecting creatures
     - multi-turn commands?
     - issue commands to more than one unit? Draw box + shift selecting? Depends on balance, if we go for a fewer-stronger-monster
