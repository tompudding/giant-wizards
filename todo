BUGS
----
done  - damage doesn't show double figures correctly
fixed - After casting a wizard blast the tab text gets drawn over itself
fixed - The damage text doesn't get drawn when someone is killed
fixed - The health_text gets drawn too high without the ridiculous hack workaround I put in
fixed - Damage text is relative to the screen, not tiles
fixed - Switching spell strength while on the non-default tab view causes issues
fixed - UI resources are allocated for AI players even though they're never used
fixed - Mouse-text doesn't disappear when you move over UI elements
fixed - characters moving onto scorched tiles crash
fixed - clicking on your wizard removes your move highlights
fixed - enemy wizards can shoot though trees
fixed - Game hangs after wizards fire a blast
fixed - valid_vectors gets called a lot. When there's a lot of tiles, that's a huge amount of CPU going to waste
fixed - The clickable area of the slider doesn't quite extend to the edges. Need to make a sub-object that's slightly smaller maybe
fixed - select next player button seems to deselect the action choice
fixed - Health text stops moving with the player for some reason
fixed - The options box is red!
fixed - Post win, things are (mayme) still fucked. Can't reproduce this right now, but I'll leave it open for a while
fixed - Depress-ness doesn't seem to work inside the boxes, I guess when the parent is not root
fixed - Clicking on buttons seems to unselect the selected action (at least in terms of the blue box)
fixed - selected border still active on game win. Actually post win, things are still fucked. Didn't fix it as I first thought
fixed - Dragging still activates buttons
fixed - The win screen doesn't work properly, and after it appears, everything else goes to shit
fixed - Dragging no longer works over the UI elements
fixed - casting a goblin onto a mountain causes a crash
